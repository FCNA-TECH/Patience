# Patience
A game of waiting made to test your patience (coded in processing). The aim of the game is to beat your high-score by staring at the screen for as long as you can, you shouldn't minimise the application or leave it and walk away as that defeats the purpose. The purpose being to take a break from all the endless watching, retweeting, liking and sharing habit that we all fall into and to take some time to just relax and think.
